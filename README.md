# conflict-dashboard


A project to visualize major geopolitical conflicts through an interactive dashboard interface that shows curated sources.

Project Goal:
- Build a modular, expandable conflict tracking tool where users can:
  - Select a region such Yemen or Ukraine
  - Preview recent news from curated sources
  - Optionally interact with a map showing article-related pinpoints
  - (In the Future) Save preferences or filter by media outlet

MVP/Simplest Working Version Scope:
- Homepage with clickable region tiles (3 rectangles or "cards")
- Region page includes:
  - Static map image or placeholder
  - Expandable "Sources" tab (ie right-to-left slide-out)
  - Source previews (logo, short description, link, date)


Tech Stack (MVP):
- HTML / CSS / JavaScript (maybe React)
- GitHub Pages or Vercel for deployment
- Local JSON for articles and source metadata
